        YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform headquartered in San Bruno, California,
        United States. Accessible worldwide,[6] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and
        Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube has more
        than 2.5 billion monthly users,[7] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos each day.[8] As
        of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[9][10]

        <q> In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[11] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded
            the</q>
        site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such
        as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option
        for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program,
        which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in
        2022.[citation needed] In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in
        revenue of 9 billion from the previous year.[1]
